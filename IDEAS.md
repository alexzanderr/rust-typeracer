i can make an issue on my github as `TODO` or `ISSUE` then make a separate branch, then make a pull request on main then merge into main on github, then `git pull github main` to update locally the `remote merge on main` and `CI`

why?

for people to see on github specific issues and todos that were implemented in the past to know better what happened
